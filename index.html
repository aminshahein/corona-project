                spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and

                Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of
                people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack
                of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame
                someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads
                rumors and myths.

              <p>
                Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards

                  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause
                  illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline
                  coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                  coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect
                  people and can spread between people. This is suspected to
                  have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East
                  Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                  Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that
                  originated from animals and then spread to people. More

                  The virus that causes COVID-19 is

                  Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the
                  illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these
                  patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home
                  (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no
                  longer pose a risk of infecting others.

                <p>
                  How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on
                  when to release someone from isolation is made on a
                  case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection
                  prevention and control experts, and public health officials
                  and involves considering specifics of each situation including
                  disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of
                  laboratory testing for that patient.

                    It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact
                    the spread of COVID- 19. Some other viruses, like the common
                    cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but
                    that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
                    these viruses during other months. At this time, it is not
                    known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when
                    weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about
                    the transmissibility, severity, and other features
                    associated with COVID- 19 and investigations are ongoing.

                    Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                    person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently
                    there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19
                    associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is
                    important to always wash your hands with soap and water for
                    20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash
                    your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or
                    going to the bathroom.

                    It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by
                    touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and
                    then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
                    but this is not thought to be the main way the virus
                    spreads.

                    In general, because of poor survivability of these
                    coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of
                    spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over
                    a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or

some patients may nave aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore
throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some
people become infected but don't develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell
Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing specia
treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets GOVID-19 becomes seriously
Il and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying
medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more
ikely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing
should seek medical attention

                nfected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from
